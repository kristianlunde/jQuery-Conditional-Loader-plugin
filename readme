# jQuery Conditional Loader plugin

Simplifies the process of doing conditional loading of data depending on the window size of the browser.

This is an alpha version and is due to be changed soon. It is not guaranteed that it works as it should either.

Usage:

$('div[role="twitter"]').content({size: 640, html: 'Display 2 tweets'})
	.content({size: 992, html : 'display 5 tweets'})
	.content({size: 1364, html : 'display all tweets'});
